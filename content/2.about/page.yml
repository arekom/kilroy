  **Hey, my name is Arek Komarnicki aka "arekom" and I'm 22 years old "someday" web developer. Nice to meet you!**

  I have graduated from Middlesex University of London in the field of Computer Newtorks 'Network Programming' to be exact.
  And since then I'm trying to find my place in this realm of technology, exploring all of it's possibilities...

  But I presume you are here, because you want to know a little bit more about this blog
  or what I the author can offer you. Well, this blog is my place to collect all my thoughts, findings and experiences about 
  everything related to web, it can be development or some fancy design --I like those flat UI's in particular.
  And now please let me take you on the short journey of Kilroy's history.
  
  My older blog "Kilroy" was powered by the Octpress framework and was hosted on Heroku. 

  After couple of week of using the Octpress framework, I came to the conclusion that it was a little overkill to do all this unnecessary 
  stuff just to post an article once in a week.
  Don't get me wrong I still love the Octopress and I think it's a one of the best blogging frameworks out there 
  but I needed something that didn't required syncing the database or me to push everything to heroku and github branches everytime. 
  Therefore after couple of weeks Kilroy met [Stacey](http://staceyapp.com/).

  **Stacey it's a lightweight content management system. No database setup or installation files, simply drop the application on a server and it runs. 
  Your content is managed by creating folders and editing text files. No login screens, no admin interface**.

  I enjoy working with new technologies so the task of deploying new blogging framework wasn't a big one.

  Therefore I deplyoed the new framework and started the styling part and that mark the end of this short story. By the way, if you want to see some code and projects 
  I'm currently working on, I put my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/arekom) so feel free to fork whatever you like and 
  if you have any comments, just drop me a line. Besides the GitHub I also hang out mostly on 
  [Google+](http://plus.google.com/111893046260780461288) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/arekom_).
  
  I also love to travel, so when you visit me on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/arek.komarnicki/map) you will find out more about that.


  Ok, that's it for now. I would love to write more but then you wouldn't have time to explore this awesome blog! 
  But if you want to chat or you have an awesome project you want to talk about please send me a message via contact form and I promise you to respond within 24 hours.

  Take care!
