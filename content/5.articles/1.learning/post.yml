intro: |
  Let me take you on the short journey of Kilroy's history.

  My older blog "Kilroy" was powered by the Octpress framework and was hosted on Heroku. 
  After couple of week of using the Octpress framework, I came to the conclusion that it was a little overkill to do all this unnecessary 
  stuff just to post an article once in a week.

  Don't get me wrong I still love the Octopress and I think it's a one of the best blogging frameworks out there 
  but I needed something that didn't required syncing the database or me to push everything to heroku and github branches everytime. 
  Therefore after couple of weeks Kilroy met [Stacey](http://staceyapp.com/).

  **Stacey it's a lightweight content management system. No database setup or installation files, simply drop the application on a server and it runs. 
  Your content is managed by creating folders and editing text files. No login screens, no admin interface**.

  I enjoy working with new technologies so the task of deploying new blogging framework wasn't a big one.
  Therefore I deplyoed the new framework and started coding...
