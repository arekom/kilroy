  **Here you can find all the details about the latest project I'm currently working on.**



  **Project for this month is:**

  **Name : MEMOR**

  **Languages : RUBY, CSS, ERB**

  **Frameworks used : SINATRA**

  

  Memor is a tiny web-applications written in Ruby and build using Sinatra - Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort:
  
  Here is a example of route using Sinatra :

      get '/:id/complete' do  
          n = Note.get params[:id]  
          n.complete = n.complete ? 0 : 1 # flip it  
          n.updated_at = Time.now  
          n.save  
          redirect '/'  
      end 

  This route corresponds to the 'complete task' functionality. Whenever user click **completed** the background of the taks 
  is going to change the color from default grey to alert red. It's a sexy solution or at least better than displaying huge or tiny text saying that
  your task has been completed.

  By the way, I just love when Sinatra is loaded in the terminal this message pop out:

      == Sinatra has taken the stage ...
