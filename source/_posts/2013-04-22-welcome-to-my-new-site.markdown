## Hello everyone!

Let me welcome you on my brand new site. My earlier "web house" was a boring and static webpage so after a year of manually adding everything to the site i grow tired of it.

As you can see the new site is still under development, i need to theme this page correctly ( nobody likes default things ). The other thing that i would like to present you is the responsive functionality of this page. My older site wasn't responsive so everything below __480px__  was cut by the browser window. Now you can view this page on any browser and any device and it will look great!

 I hope you find something interesting here, and please feel free to check my projects on [github](https://github.com/arekom)!
